			<p class="book1desc"> After finding the body of a dragon in a metallic desert, Red finds out that he is the reincarnation of a messiah worshipped by an insectoid alien race bent on invading his star system. Swept into a dangerous adventure across glacial swamps, cloud cities, and dead stars -- Red must evade his true purpose in the world, to summon a forsaken deity trapped in another realm.

			Travel into a world unlike any other, a world teeming with creatures the size of planets, parasites that can lay waste to entire civilizations, and mysterious energy sources that can decay the lifeforce of stars. What starts as only a whisper in the darkness, grows into a tale of epic proportions.

			Phantasia is a future fantasy epic that stands at 180,000 words. </p>
